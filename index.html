            Neymar came into the spotlight at Santos, where he made his professional debut aged <span class="span2">17</span>. He helped the club win two successive <span>Campeonato Paulista championships</span> , <span>a Copa do Brasil</span>, and the 2011 <span>Copa Libertadores</span>; the latter being Santos' first since 1963. Neymar was <span class="span2">twice</span> named the South American Footballer of the Year, in 2011 and 2012, and soon relocated to Europe to join Barcelona. As part of Barcelona's attacking trio with Lionel Messi and Luis SuÃ¡rez, he won the <span>continental treble of La Liga</span>, <span>the Copa del Rey</span>, and <span>the UEFA Champions League</span>, and finished <span class="span2">third</span> for the FIFA Ballon d'Or in 2015 for his performances. He then attained a domestic double in the 2015â€“16 season. In 2017, Neymar transferred to Paris Saint-Germain in a move worth <span class="span2">â‚¬222 million</span>, making him the most expensive player ever.

            <h1>NATIONAL CAREER OVERVIEW</h1>

            <p>
                With 68 goals in 108 matches for Brazil since debuting at age 18, Neymar is the second highest goalscorer for his national team, trailing only PelÃ©. He was a key player in Brazil's victories at the 2011 South American Youth Championship, where he finished as leading goalscorer, and the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup, where he won the Golden Ball as player of the tournament. His participation in the 2014 FIFA World Cup and 2015 Copa AmÃ©rica was cut short by injury and a suspension, respectively, before captaining Brazil to their first Olympic gold medal in men's football at the 2016 Summer Olympics. Two years later, having renounced the captaincy, he featured at the 2018 FIFA World Cup.
